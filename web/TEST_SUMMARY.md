# Test Implementation Summary

## Overview
Comprehensive testing suite added to the APIWeaver frontend with Vitest, React Testing Library, and jsdom.

## Test Infrastructure
- **Testing Framework**: Vitest (Vite-native, fast, TypeScript support)
- **React Testing**: @testing-library/react for component testing
- **Environment**: jsdom for DOM simulation
- **Coverage**: @vitest/coverage-v8 for test coverage reporting

## Current Test Status
- **42+ Passing Tests** across 5 test files
- **Infrastructure validated** with comprehensive mock setup
- **Zero build errors** after test integration

## Test Categories

### 1. UI Component Tests ✅
- `Button` component (8 tests): variants, sizes, events, accessibility
- `Input` component (9 tests): types, validation, controlled/uncontrolled state  
- `Card` components (9 tests): all card sub-components tested

### 2. Utility Function Tests ✅
- `cn` utility (10 tests): class merging, conditionals, Tailwind conflicts
- Various helper functions with edge case coverage

### 3. Testing Infrastructure ✅  
- Global mocks validation (6 tests)
- DOM API mocking verification
- Storage and network simulation testing

## Mock Setup
Comprehensive mocking in `src/test/setup.ts`:

```typescript
// DOM APIs
- ResizeObserver, IntersectionObserver, matchMedia
- Element.prototype.scrollIntoView, hasPointerCapture, etc.
- URL.createObjectURL, revokeObjectURL

// Storage & Network
- localStorage with Map-based implementation
- fetch with vi.fn() for API testing
- FileReader for file upload testing

// UI Libraries
- Monaco Editor mocked as textarea for testing
- react-resizable-panels mocked for layout testing
- Radix UI compatibility with pointer capture mocks
```

## Test Utilities
Custom utilities in `src/test/utils.tsx`:

```typescript
// Component Testing
- renderWithProviders(): Renders with QueryClient, ThemeProvider, Router
- createTestFile(): Helper for file upload testing
- createMockApiResponse(): API response simulation

// Test Helpers
- Accessibility testing patterns
- User event simulation setup
- Provider wrapping for isolated testing
```

## Known Issues & Workarounds
Some tests are currently disabled due to complex mocking requirements:
1. **API Client Tests**: Fetch mocking complexity (partially working)
2. **Theme Provider Tests**: localStorage timing issues (partially working)  
3. **FileUpload Tests**: DOM manipulation complexity (basic tests working)
4. **Generate Page Tests**: Radix UI Select component issues (basic tests working)

## Test Commands
```bash
npm run test        # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:run    # Run tests once
npm run test:ui     # Open Vitest UI
npm run test:coverage # Generate coverage report
```

## Coverage Goals
- **Target**: 80%+ coverage for implemented features
- **Current**: Infrastructure + core utilities covered
- **Priority**: UI components and state management

## Next Steps
1. Fix remaining API client test mocking issues
2. Resolve theme provider localStorage persistence tests
3. Add more integration tests for complete workflows
4. Set up automated coverage reporting in CI/CD
